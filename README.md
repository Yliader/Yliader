-  Hi, Iâ€™m @Yliader
- I make modular synth, music and retro game.
- I'm currently learning everything that could help me to produce art, by any ways, but most of time by practising
- I'm not looking for collaborating projects, but if you think I can help you or you want to make a collab, join me here :
